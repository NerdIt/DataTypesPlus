 WIP Custom data type library for Java
 
 
 DynamicDictionary class (or the DD class):
 
 This was me just trying to recreate the C# .Net Dictionary.
 It includes the basic methods: 
  - add (Par: Key, Value)(Disc: adds element with assigned key to dictionary)
  - remove (Par: Key)(Disc: removes element based on it's key)
  - removeAt (Par: Index)(Disc: removes element based on it's list index)
  - get (Par: Key)(Disc: returns element value)
  - length (Disc: returns dictionary length)
  
  
 Vector2, Vector3, Vector4 classes:
 
 Just thought this might be helpful to someone.
 
 Each Vector includes its own respective point locations (x,y,z,w).
 The methods are what you would expect (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and averages)
